# NetboxPS
###### Powershell Netbox API module

# Disclaimer
This module is beta. Use it at your own risk. I have only added functions as I have needed them, so not everything is available.

All functions are exported at the moment, including internal/private functions.

# Description
This module is a wrapper for the [Netbox](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox) API.

# Usage
1. Install module from the `netboxPS` folder
2. Import module
3. Connect to an API endpoint by using `Connect-NetboxAPI -Hostname netbox.example.com`

## Basic Commands

```powershell
#Just adding a new IP
New-NetboxIPAMAddress -Address 10.0.0.1/24 -Dns_name this.is.thedns.fqdn -Custom_Fields @{CustomFieldID="CustomFieldContent"} -Tenant 1 -Description "Description"

#Creating a new VM, add an interface and assign Interface IP
function New-NBVirtualMachine
{
    [CmdletBinding()]
    [Alias()]
    [OutputType([int])]
    Param
    (
        [string]$Name,
        [string]$Cluster,
        [string]$IP,
        [string]$tenant,
        [string]$VMNICName
    )

    Begin
    {
        $NBCluster = Get-NetboxVirtualizationCluster -name $Cluster
        $NBTenant = Get-NetboxTenant -Name $tenant
    }
    Process
    {
        $vm = New-NetboxVirtualMachine -Name $Name -Cluster $NBCluster.id -Tenant $NBtenant.id
        $interface = Add-NetboxVirtualMachineInterface -Name $VMNICName -Virtual_Machine $vm.id


        $NBip = New-NetboxIPAMAddress -Address $IP -Tenant $NBtenant.id 
        Set-NetboxIPAMAddress -Assigned_Object_Type virtualization.vminterface -Assigned_Object_Id $interface.id -id $NBip.id
        Set-NetboxVirtualMachine -Primary_IP4 $NBip.id -Id $vm.id
    }
}

```

# Notes
I started this project years ago with Powershell Studio using the built in deployment methods, learning Git, and learning PS best practices. So please forgive any "obvious" mistakes ðŸ˜…
Over time I have had to adjust my methods for deployment... change the design of functions, and refactor code as I learn new and better things. 

This was built out of a need at my job to interact with Netbox for automation. Only recently has it become a "public" project with other collaborators (which I truly appreciate!).
I have done my best to ensure each function does exactly one thing according to the API. 

I will do my best to keep up, but please understand it is given attention as I can at work. As time permits, I will open issues for TODOs for things I have wanted to do for a while, just haven't had time or enough "need" to do them.
